Application designed for students and teachers to sign in. Used PHP and AJAX. I created a MVC and a database on MySQL. 

Students can see their classes and sign in.

Teachers can sign in and see, modify, add and edit classes and students. They generate a code to give to the the students to enable them to sign in. 

**Getting Started...**

Git Bash command = 

npm install config.php

ssh to clone the project

git clone git@github.com:Justineleq/BriefSignApp.git

Create an MYSQL database with the mysql located in src/migrations.

**Improvements I still want to make...**

Creating Fetch/Ajax for all database entries.
Finishing all frontend.
CRUD for classes, students, users.
